Motorola Dynatac 8000X
---
Looking for references I found this old Motorola phone in an Ebay store and I really liked the retro and vintage touch, so I decided to model it and give it some of my touch.
The prop has 7,760 tris and I mainly wanted to focus on getting more photorealism as well as learning more how to optimize the props.
