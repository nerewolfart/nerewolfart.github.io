70's Walkie-Talkie
---
Motivated by a concept art I found of a 70's Walkie-Talkie, I decided to test my skills on hard surfaces. Using a workflow centered on Blender and Zbrush programs, I focused especially on achieving hyper-realism through detailed textures.
Thanks to this project I learned to go much deeper into the baking method of Marmoset Toolbag 4, but especially in the use of Zbrush to perform the Highpoly of the model and the use of Marmoset Toolbag lighting to achieve a realistic render.
The model has been made in Blender and the Highpoly in Zbrush while the baking has been done in Marmoset Toolbag 4 and the texturing in Susbtance Painter and Photoshop.
